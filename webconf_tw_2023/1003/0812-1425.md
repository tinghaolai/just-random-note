### hop-by-hop attack

GET / HTTP/1.1


When checking IP white list, 
and http header `Connection: close, X-Important`, 
proxy server will remove `X-Important`,
and maybe use `REMOTE_ADDR` as backup,
which is IP of proxy server and pass the check.

make server think is profile page as css and cache it,
then attacker can see the info from this cached page without login.
