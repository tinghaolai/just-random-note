## Case 1: different account

Let's say you're using account: `A`, 

and you want to push repository `C` which only account `B` has permission,

but when you push, it will say `remote: Permission to {accountB}/{repositoryC}.git denied to {accountA}`.

### Case 1 solution

* Execute `git config credential.username "{accountB}}"`
* Enter token generate from github
